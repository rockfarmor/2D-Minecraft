# 2D-Minecraft
An old project from 2015. This is a 2d minecraft clone, created in java with the swing component.
The project was never finished, but includes a playable version of the game with crafting, infinite world generation, dynamic lightning etc.
I have no plan to continue the development.

Here are some screenshots:
